# UW TCSS555 - Machine Learning

The course studies the methods for supervised and unsupervised machine learning, such as decision trees, random forests, boosted decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks, deep learning, and clustering, explored a variety of machine learning algorithms (such as decision trees, naive Bayes, ensemble methods, logistic regression, neural networks, deep learning, clustering) in your own words, as well as illustrate the underlying ideas with small pen-and-paper examples.

Throughout this course, we applies these machine learning algorithms to develop up a machine learning system for automatic recognition of the age, gender, and personality to social media users.
